Developing a project using TRIQS or within TRIQS
================================================

Welcome to this tutorial! The goal of these notes is to give a step by step
introduction to the development of a code that either uses TRIQS as
an external library or a new code within TRIQS.

Rather than being completely general this tutorial will follow a goal:
write your own CT-INT impurity solver.
