Developing a project with TRIQS
===============================

Welcome to this tutorial! The goal of these notes is to give a step-by-step
introduction to the development of a code that either

  *  uses TRIQS as an external library
  *  is a part of TRIQS

Rather than being completely general this tutorial will follow a goal:
write your own CT-INT impurity solver.
